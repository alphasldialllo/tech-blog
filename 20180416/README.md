# Saving lifes of iPhones batteries [Part 1 of 2]

You probably had battery frustration. New age sickness. Your phone died already several times - in least expected moments. You started to wonder: who's fault is that? You go to the settings looking for the hog. There it is. An application that was doing something in the background, even worse GPS! You take it's permissions back. Now you're safe - never opening the app back again.

But when you are a developer. You don't want above to happen to the app you're working on, but still you want to give these features, because they're cool. A that's totally reasonable.

What can we do about it?

It appears best practices are out there, but none cares. Here I'd like to take a chance to overview them and apply them to real life scenario. For now only for iOS, but in the next post for Android, eventually ending up with pretty robust comparison of both.


## What really drains the battery?


## How can we measure battery consumption?


## How to analyze your project needs?


## What are the tools to achieve low battery consumption?
